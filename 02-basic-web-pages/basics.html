    <h1> Interneting is Easy!</h1>
    <p> First, we need to learn some basic HTML. </p>
    <h2> Headings</h2>
    <p> Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>
  </body>
  <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an ordered list.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add a "ul" element</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </<ol>
