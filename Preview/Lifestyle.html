    <h3> Living In Pittsburgh</h3>
    <h2>"Living in Pittsburgh Isn't Fancy, But It's Real"</h2>
    <p2> When I first came to Pittsburgh, I didn't really know what to expect. When I arrived at school, I had only been to Pittsburgh twice. I had only heard many stories from my parents, who grew up in Western PA. What I found when I came here was a community. People who live in Pittsburgh are proud to be there and they are passionate. With amazing sports teams, great food, and lots to do, Pittsburgh has become a top city. Every weekend I found myself in a new neighborhood, astounded by what it has to offer. There is something new around every corner!</p2>
