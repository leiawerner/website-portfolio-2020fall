What you are seeing in this preview is my website's homepage. I have decided to name my website 'Leia Maria' which are my first and middle names. On the homepage I have included two images. One of myself, and one of Pittsburgh. These are brief introductory images to welcome viewers. I will have three pages linked to my blog. They are movies, music, and lifestyle. These will be the different pages my readers can go to to read on my blog. I added a brief intro at the bottom along with my signature quote. I also added a flexbar which includes links to my social media accounts. This home-page took a lot of experimentation (trying and re-trying) but I am pretty happy with the way it came out!
