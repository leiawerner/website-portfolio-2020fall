      <h3> 3 Quick Tips for buying a Record Player </h3>
<h4> 1. <strong>Budget</strong> </h4>
<p2> This might seem obvious, but budget is important to consider before starting your research. A good way to start is by picking a brand, and looking at their different models. Consider what features you want and go from there. If you want a quality player that will protect your vinyl, stay AWAY from suitcase players.</p2>
<h5>2. Decide What Qualities Matter</h5>
<p3>Turntables all have different features. Think about which ones are most important to you. Do you want your player to have Bluetooth in our out? USB qualities to plug in your computer? Do you have your own speakers to use or do you want built in speakers? Do you want Fully Automatic, Semi-Automatic, or Manual? If you don't know what any of these terms mean, do the research before buying your player. </p3>
<h6>3. Consider Location and Accessories</h6>
<p4> Location is extremely important when finding the perfect record player. Consider what style/size will fit in your interior. If you want to be able to change the location of your player, consider portable or wireless options. A player should be placed in an area with no interference. There are also accessories to consider, like having spare needles on hand. It is also important to keep your player dust-free. A dust cover could be a good purchase for keeping your player in good shape. Find what accessories fit your needs.</p4>
