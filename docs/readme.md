The files for my website can be found in the 'Preview' folder. 
Overall, I am pretty happy with how my website has turned out. It isn't as complex as I was orginially hoping, but time and skill level restraints definitely played a part (I have never used HTML or CSS before). 
I am mainly looking for critque on the overall design of the website and not so much the writing/etc. I really don't plan on adding much unless suggested.
