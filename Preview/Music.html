      <h3> 5 Tips for buying a Record Player </h3>
<h4> 1. <strong>Budget</strong> </h4>
<p3>Though this may seem obvious, it is important to know your budget before doing a lot of research. One way to start is taking one brand such as Audio Technica for example, and looking at all of their models. Look at what features you might want such as Bluetooth or USB and go from there. The best record players that have a decent needle and more power end up being around $150 or higher. That is not saying you cannot get one at a cheaper price, but don't make the same mistake I did as a beginner. If you want to find a budget record player that is decent quality and keeps your vinyl in decent quality, steer away from suitcase models.</p3>
<h5>2. Decide What Features Matter</h5>
<p4>Is it important for you that you can easily move your record player? Then opt for a portable player. Portable is not to be mixed up with wireless. Wireless player's are also portable but have the option to be charged by batteries. Is Bluetooth important? And if so, in or out? A Bluetooth-in player gives you the option to connect your smartphone to play music through the internal speakers of the record player. A Bluetooth-out means you can connect it to Bluetooth speakers. USB is another feature to consider. A USB record player gives you the possibility to convert your records into digital audio files. There are many other things to consider, so put this into your research.</p4>
